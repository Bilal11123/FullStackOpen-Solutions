# üó≥Ô∏è Anecdote Voting App

A simple React application that displays a list of programming anecdotes and allows users to vote for their favorites. The app also shows which anecdote has received the most votes.

## üöÄ Features

- Display a random programming anecdote  
- Vote for the currently displayed anecdote  
- View the anecdote with the highest number of votes

## üß© Components

### **`App`**
The main component that:
- Manages state for the current anecdote and vote counts  
- Displays the current anecdote and its vote total  
- Includes buttons to:
  - Show a new random anecdote
  - Vote for the current anecdote  

### **`MostVoted`**
A child component that:
- Receives all anecdotes and their vote counts as props  
- Determines which anecdote has the most votes  
- Displays that anecdote and its total vote count

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Random Anecdote Selection**  
   The `random()` function generates a random index (0‚Äì7) to display a new anecdote when the **Next Anecdote** button is clicked.

2. **Voting Mechanism**  
   The `vote()` function:
   - Creates a copy of the `votes` array  
   - Increments the vote count for the currently displayed anecdote  
   - Updates the state with the new vote array  

3. **Most Voted Anecdote**  
   The `MostVoted` component:
   - Finds the maximum number of votes  
   - Displays the corresponding anecdote and its vote count
